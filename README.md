# CHAIN AID - Make Donations in the most transparent way ever.
Welcome to Chain-Aid , a blockchain-based donation platform that allows individuals and organizations to easily donate to causes they care about.
Blockchain technology offers many advantages for donations, including faster and more secure transactions, lower fees, and greater transparency. With blockchain, donors can have confidence that their donations are going directly to the cause they support.

We're proud to offer a platform where NGOs can register and receive donations from supporters around the world.
Our platform uses blockchain technology to securely and transparently process donations. Users can connect their metamask wallet, choose a cause to support,and an amount to donate and send eth (cryptocurrency) to the designated address. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability.

With every successful donation, users will receive an NFT that represents their contribution to the cause.
Our team DECODERS  is passionate about using blockchain technology to make a positive impact in the world. We believe that donations should be transparent, secure, and accessible to everyone.

## The problem it solves

Present donation systems pose a lot of problems including :
- Lack of transparency: Many donation apps don't provide enough transparency about how donations are used or distributed. This can lead to mistrust and skepticism among donors, and may discourage them from making donations in the future
- High transaction fees: Some donation apps charge high transaction fees, which can eat into the amount of money that actually goes to the intended cause. This can be frustrating for donors who want to ensure that their contributions are making a real impact.
- Lack of accountability: In some cases, it's difficult to track how donations are being used and whether they're having a positive impact. This lack of accountability can be a turn-off for donors who want to see tangible results from their contributions.
- Limited payment options: Some donation apps only accept certain types of payments, such as credit cards or PayPal. This can be inconvenient for donors who prefer to use other payment methods, such as cryptocurrency.

## Challenges we ran into
Since we were working online and all the members were from different places , there was difficulty in collaborating and finding a perfect time to work together. Also since we had our classes and work it was a bit hectic to manage everything.
We faced some difficulty in integrating the smart contract with the frontend.

## Future scopes
We plan to integrate push notifications and notify users of the status of donations made.
Apart from that we wish to implement push chat providing a platform for the donator to chat with the NGO's.
Also we wish to give users(Below Poverty Line Users) access to the plaform and let the NGO's distribute the donations through the platform for the needy ones.
